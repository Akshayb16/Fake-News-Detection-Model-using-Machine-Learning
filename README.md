📰 **Fake News Detection with Machine Learning**

Built an end-to-end Fake News Detection System that analyzes the authenticity of news articles using NLP and supervised machine learning models. Using a dataset of over 45,000 articles (True & Fake), I applied TF-IDF vectorization and trained multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.

After preprocessing (text normalization, punctuation removal, HTML stripping, etc.), the data was vectorized and split into training and testing sets. Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved the highest performance with accuracy over 98%, while Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting occasionally overfit or misclassified certain real news.

🔍 Highlights:

* 📊 45k+ news articles processed and balanced for fair model training
* ✅ Achieved 98%+ accuracy with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
* 🧪 Built a manual testing pipeline to validate real-world news inputs
* 🧼 Implemented advanced text cleaning techniques to improve signal-to-noise ratio
* 📈 Evaluated models with **precision, recall, F1-score** and **real-time predictions**

This project showcases how machine learning and NLP can combat misinformation.
